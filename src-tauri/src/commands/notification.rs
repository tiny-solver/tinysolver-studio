//! OS notifications, and the one affordance the platform gives us for
//! diagnosing them.
//!
//! Neither notification backend we use exposes a permission state on desktop:
//! `tauri-plugin-notification`'s desktop implementation hard-codes
//! `PermissionState::Granted` for both `permission_state()` and
//! `request_permission()`, and `mac-notification-sys` has no authorization API
//! at all. So the frontend cannot render "allowed / blocked" without inventing
//! it. What it CAN do is send a test notification and offer a shortcut to the
//! system pane that actually owns the decision — which is why both commands
//! here return real errors instead of best-effort silence.
