//! Per-launch scratch directories for ACP agent processes.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Some agent binaries are self-extracting archives that unpack into the system
//! temp directory on every launch and only clean up on a GRACEFUL exit. codeg
//! ends agent processes with `kill_tree`, which on Windows terminates
//! unconditionally, so that cleanup never runs. The Antigravity ACP server is
//! the acute case: its Windows build is a PyInstaller *onefile* whose archive
//! unpacks to **1.17 GB** per launch (verified against the shipped binary: 8261
//! TOC entries, 1192.3 MB of `b` entries plus an 8.7 MB PYZ). One user
//! accumulated 113 orphaned `%TEMP%\_MEI*` directories totalling 107.70 GB in
//! seven days and ran their system drive out of space.
//!
//! The lever is entirely host-side. The PyInstaller bootloader resolves its
//! extraction root through `GetTempPathW` (confirmed: the shipped bootloader
//! imports `GetTempPathW` and not `GetTempPath2W`, and the archive carries no
//! `pyi-runtime-tmpdir` option), and `GetTempPathW` reads `TMP`, then `TEMP`,
//! then `USERPROFILE`. Pointing those at a directory codeg owns turns an
//! unbounded leak into a directory codeg can delete.
//!
//! macOS is the same bug two orders of magnitude smaller: that build is not
//! PyInstaller, but it still drops ~172 KB of read-only resource files into
//! `TMPDIR` per launch and still leaks them when killed. So the isolation is
//! applied to every agent launch on every platform rather than special-cased.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! Three ordering rules make the sweeps sound without holding a lock across a
//! multi-gigabyte delete:
//!
//! 1. **Register before `mkdir`.** There is no instant at which a scratch
//!    directory exists on disk without already being in [`REGISTRY`].
//! 2. **Unregister only after the directory is gone** (or after the retry
//!    ladder gives up, at which point it is by definition no longer live).
//! 3. **Diff under the lock, delete outside it.** A sweep enumerates, diffs and
//!    claims under the mutex, then releases it before deleting.
//!
//! Together those mean a directory created after a sweep's snapshot was
//! registered *before* it appeared on disk, so it cannot have been in the diff;
//! and a creation landing between the unlock and the delete cannot collide,
//! because names carry a fresh random suffix and are created with `create_dir`
//! (which fails on an existing name).
