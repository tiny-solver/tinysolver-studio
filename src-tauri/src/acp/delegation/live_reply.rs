//! `ChildLiveReplyLookup` — broker capability that peeks at a still-running
//! delegation child's **in-memory** session to pull a one-line "what it's doing
//! right now" hint. The broker uses it to enrich `get_delegation_status`'s
//! running report from a bare `"Running."` into a two-line
//! `"Running.\nLatest sub-agent reply: …"`, so the parent LLM (and the user) can
//! see the child is genuinely making progress. The hint sits on its own line so
//! content-only hosts can anchor "still running" to the standalone first line
//! (see `attach_live_reply` in `super::broker`).
//!
//! Kept behind a trait for the same reason as [`super::meta_writer`] /
//! [`super::broker::ChildStatusLookup`]: the broker stays decoupled from
//! `ConnectionManager`, and unit tests can inject a deterministic reply without
//! a live ACP session. Production wires [`ConnectionManagerLiveReplyLookup`] via
//! [`super::broker::DelegationBroker::with_live_reply_lookup`].
//!
//! Lock-ordering note: the broker calls this **after** releasing its pending
//! mutex, so reading the child's `SessionState` (a separate `RwLock`) can never
//! invert lock order against the broker's own state.
