//! `DelegationEventEmitter` — broker capability for surfacing
//! `AcpEvent::DelegationCompleted` to the parent's event stream.
//!
//! Parallel to [`crate::acp::delegation::meta_writer::DelegationMetaWriter`]:
//! both abstract over the broker's access to the parent connection's
//! `(state, emitter)` pair so the broker can be unit-tested without spinning
//! up a `ConnectionManager`. Together they form the broker's two-output
//! capability surface — meta writes patch the persisted `ToolCallState`,
//! event emits drive the live frontend `DelegationContext`.
//!
//! The broker calls this from every terminal path:
//!
//! 1. `complete_call` — happy path (kind=ok) and error completions
//!    (kind=err) propagated by the listener/lifecycle.
//! 2. `cancel_by_external_handle` — MCP `notifications/cancelled`
//!    routed from the companion drains the pending entry; emits
//!    `Err{error_code: "canceled"}`.
//! 3. `handle_request` completion-channel-dropped — emits `Err{error_code: "canceled"}`.
//! 4. `cancel_by_child_connection` — emits `Err{error_code: "canceled"}` for
//!    every drained pending entry whose child matches.
//! 5. `cancel_by_parent` — emits `Err{error_code: "canceled"}` for every
//!    drained pending entry whose parent matches.
//!
//! Emits are skipped when the broker is operating on a synthetic
//! `parent_tool_use_id` (the `"delegation-*"` UUID fallback) because no
//! `tool_call_id`-keyed UI exists to receive them — same guard as the meta
//! writer. The frontend's snapshot path will still recover state from the
//! broker's meta write.
