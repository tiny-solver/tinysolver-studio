//! Interactive multiple-choice question ("ask the user") domain types.
//!
//! Mid-turn an agent can ask the user one or more multiple-choice questions and
//! BLOCK until the user answers — the `ask_user_question` MCP tool exposed by
//! `codeg-mcp`. Unlike live-feedback ([`crate::acp::feedback`]), which is a
//! non-blocking pull the user pushes into, a question PAUSES the agent's tool
//! call: the questions render as an interactive card above the conversation
//! input box (driven by [`crate::acp::session_state::SessionState`], in-memory
//! and turn-scoped — it is real-time steering, not durable history), and the
//! tool call returns only once the user submits their choices.
//!
//! This module holds the pieces shared across layers so the manager, the
//! delegation listener, the MCP companion plumbing, and the settings command
//! don't each grow their own copy:
//!   * [`QuestionSpec`] / [`QuestionOption`] — one question + its choices.
//!   * [`PendingQuestionState`] — the awaiting-answer set stored on the session.
//!   * [`QuestionAnswer`] / [`QuestionAnswerItem`] — the user's submission
//!     (frontend → backend).
//!   * [`QuestionOutcome`] / [`QuestionAnsweredItem`] — the self-describing
//!     result handed back to the blocked tool (so the companion can render it
//!     without re-holding the questions).
//!   * [`SessionQuestionAccess`] — the listener-facing trait the production
//!     `ConnectionManager` implements (kept here so the listener can be unit
//!     tested with an in-memory stub, mirroring `SessionFeedbackAccess`).
//!   * [`QuestionRuntimeConfig`] — the hot-swappable "is the feature on?" flag,
//!     read at MCP injection time (mirrors [`crate::acp::feedback`]).
