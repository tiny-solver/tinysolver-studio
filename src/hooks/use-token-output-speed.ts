 * reading would freeze rather than fall through a quiet long-running tool, a
 * retry backoff, or a permission / question prompt blocking the turn.
 *
 * The connection dispatches far more often than this (once per wire envelope),
 * but the smoother is time-constant based rather than per-event, so a coarser
 * regular sample reads the same rate for a fraction of the work.
