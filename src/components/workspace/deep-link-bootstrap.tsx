 * already registered a listener, so the emit for a cold-start link is dropped
 * on the floor. The backend parks the resolved target and sends a payload-less
 * `workspace://deep-link-pending` nudge instead; `takePendingDeepLink` is an
 * atomic take, so the mount drain and every nudge-driven drain compete for one
 * slot and exactly one of them opens the tab. Nothing can be replayed onto a
 * later mount, and nothing opens twice.
 *
 * Latest workspace state is held in a ref so the single subscription always
 * sees fresh state without re-subscribing on every change. A request that
 * arrives before folders/tabs hydrate is queued and replayed.
