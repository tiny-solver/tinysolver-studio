/**
 * Bordered surface that groups related settings rows. Rows stacked inside one
 * card get a hairline between them, which is what makes options that belong
 * together (merge strategy + what happens to the worktree afterwards) read as
 * one decision instead of two unrelated lines.
 *
 * `bg-muted/40` rather than `bg-card`: in the light theme `--card` is the same
 * white as `--background`, so a card would only be an outline; muted gives a
 * faint fill in light mode and a slight lift over the dialog in dark mode.
 *
 * Lives in `shared/` because it is the house style for a settings surface, not
 * a task-board component: the task settings dialog was simply the first to use
 * it, and the custom-agent panel in Settings now shares it.
