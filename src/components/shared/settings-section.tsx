/**
 * Page-level building blocks for a settings tab, one level above the row
 * grammar in `setting-card.tsx`: the titled block a page is made of, the
 * banner it reports a failed load through, and the footer it saves from.
 *
 * The split mirrors how the surfaces are read: `SettingsSection` says what a
 * group of options is for, `SettingCard` groups the options that are one
 * decision, and `SettingRow` is a single option. Before this existed every
 * section hand-rolled the same header markup, which is how the page ended up
 * with two different error banners and five subtly different save footers.

 * top (`space-y-1`, so they read as one unit rather than two stacked lines),
 * and the content below is spaced at the same rhythm the cards use inside a
 * dialog — the whole page then has a single vertical cadence.
 *
 * With `control`, the header doubles as the section's single {@link SettingRow}:
 * the heading labels the control instead of a row title one line below saying
 * the same thing. Whatever else the section holds still goes in cards below, so
 * "master switch + the options it gates" reads as one block that collapses to a
 * single line when the switch is off.
 *
 * The bordered `bg-card` surface is deliberately the same shell the other
 * settings tabs use, so adopting this component changes the grammar *inside* a
 * section without making one tab look foreign next to its siblings.
