/**
 * Page-level building blocks for a settings tab, one level above the row
 * grammar in `setting-card.tsx`: the titled block a page is made of, the
 * banner it reports a failed load through, and the footer it saves from.
 *
 * The split mirrors how the surfaces are read: `SettingsSection` says what a
 * group of options is for, `SettingCard` groups the options that are one
 * decision, and `SettingRow` is a single option. Before this existed every
 * section hand-rolled the same header markup, which is how the page ended up
 * with two different error banners and five subtly different save footers.

 *
 * The bordered `bg-card` surface is deliberately the same shell the other
 * settings tabs use, so adopting this component changes the grammar *inside* a
 * section without making one tab look foreign next to its siblings.
