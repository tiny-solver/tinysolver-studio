/**
 * Floating chip that follows the pointer while a conversation tab is dragged
 * over ANOTHER split group. The dragged tab itself is axis-locked inside its
 * own strip (Reorder `drag="x"` + overflow clipping), so this ghost is the
 * only visual that crosses group boundaries — it appears exactly while a
 * foreign drop target is live, alongside that target's highlight.
 *
 * Portal to <body>: ancestors animate with transforms, which would re-anchor
 * `position: fixed` to themselves instead of the viewport.
 *
 * Text-selection suppression during a drag is NOT here: it belongs to every tab
 * drag (within-group sorting, the unsplit strip), not just the cross-group ones
 * that produce a ghost, so `TabItem` holds it via `drag-selection-guard`.
